# Virtual Coffee Machine

## Description
This project is a **Virtual Coffee Machine** that enables users to order coffee through hand gestures. Utilizing the `OpenCV` library for computer vision, the `cvzone` Hand Tracking Module for gesture recognition, and `pyttsx3` for text-to-speech feedback, the system provides an intuitive and engaging interface. It can also be adapted to support users with visual impairments.

## Features
- **Hand Gesture Recognition:** Select coffee types, sugar levels, and cup sizes using simple hand gestures.
- **Voice Feedback:** The system speaks out the selections, confirming orders and enhancing usability.
- **Dynamic Bill Calculation:** Automatically calculates the total cost based on selected options.
- **Accessibility:** Designed with inclusivity in mind, making it a potential tool for blind and visually impaired individuals.
- **Interactive User Interface:** Combines real-time webcam feed with a graphical interface for an immersive experience.
